## Machine Learning Internship Projects

## Overview
This repository contains three machine learning classification projects completed during my internship. Each task addresses a real-world problem and uses three key supervised learning algorithms:
~Logistics Regression ~Random Forest
~Naive Bayes

The goal is to build, evaluate, and compare these models for prediction accuracy and performance.


##  Projects

1. Churn Modelling
Objective: Predict whether a customer will leave the service (churn) based on features such as contract type, tenure, payment method, etc.
Dataset: churn_modelling.csv
Models Used: Logistic Regression, 
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy ,Recall,Precision Confusion Matrix, Visualization.

 2. Spam Detection
Objective : Classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam) using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
Dataset: spam.csv
Models Used: Naive Bayes (with TF-IDF), Logistic Regression. 
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix,Recall,Precision.

3. Fraud Detection
Objective: Detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset.
Datasets: fraudTrain.csv, fraudTest.csv
Models Used*: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.

*Technologies Used*

Languages: Python  Libraries:
~ pandas, numpy – Data manipulation
~scikit-learn – Machine learning models & evaluation
  - matplotlib, seaborn data visualization
 sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer – Text vectorization.
